API Overview



The MoviesDatabase API provides a wide range of movie-related data, including details about movies, TV shows, actors, genres, images, and trending content. It enables developers to search for movies, retrieve metadata, and access detailed information such as cast, crew, ratings, and release dates. The API is useful for building applications that need entertainment-related content, such as movie recommendation apps, streaming dashboards, or catalog explorers.

Authentication



Authentication is done using an API key provided by RapidAPI.



Every request must include the following headers:



X-RapidAPI-Key: YOUR\_API\_KEY

X-RapidAPI-Host: moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com





Without these headers, requests will fail with an authentication error.



Error Handling



Common error responses:



400 Bad Request – Invalid parameters in the request.



401 Unauthorized – Missing or invalid API key.



403 Forbidden – Access denied, often due to quota limits or restricted resource.



404 Not Found – Resource not found (e.g., invalid movie ID).



429 Too Many Requests – Rate limit exceeded.



500 Internal Server Error – Server issue; retry later.



Best practice: Always check the status code and handle errors gracefully in your code by logging errors, retrying, or displaying user-friendly messages.



Usage Limits and Best Practices



Rate Limits: The MoviesDatabase API typically enforces request limits per minute/day based on your subscription plan.



Best Practices:



Cache frequent requests to reduce API calls and improve performance.



Use specific queries instead of broad searches to avoid unnecessary data fetching.



Implement exponential backoff for retries when encountering 429 (rate limit) errors.



Always validate API responses against your TypeScript types/interfaces for reliability.
